## Project specifications

The goal of this project was to make a bingo multiplayer game, so that I could eventualy play with my friends. 
It was built using React.js and Sockets.io. Unfortenaly the game is not available yet, since there is no free hosting service that can implement a sockets.io server :(
Still, you can test the game by following the next steps.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for the frontend and go to `http://localhost:5173/`:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, on a separate terminal run the backend server:
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

You can proceed once you see a message in the console that says `Server running on port 3001`.

## Example

This how you can setup the app in your enviroment and how can play a game:
